# CA03-decision-tree
Build a decision tree classifier models, optimize model, and measure model performance

# Description
The dataset is obtained from the Census Bureau and represents salaries of people along with seven demographic variables. The following is a description of our dataset:
â€¢	Number of target classes: 2 ('>50K' and '<=50K') [ Labels: 1, 0 ]
â€¢	Number of attributes (Columns): 7
â€¢	Number of instances (Rows): 48,842

## Instructions:
1. Download Tuning_test2.csv, census_data.csv files to local computer
2. Open ipynb file
3. Click "Open in Colab" button or click the Colab link
4. Upload these two files to goolge drive
5. Run code by lines or select runtime in the menu bar - click run all in the dropdown list
